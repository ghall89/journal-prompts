# Mindfulness Journal Prompts

## About

I'm a big believer in practicing mindfulness, and I enjoy journaling. The problem is I sometimes don't know what to write in my journal, so I made this web app using React and a simple JSON database to randomly generate journal prompts.

## Future Developments

- Display a random, minimal/calming photo in the background from Unsplash.
- Move prompts into a MongoDB database, and allow users to add their own prompts.
