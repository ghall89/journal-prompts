# Mindfulness Journal Prompts

## Description

### User Story

As a user I'd like an app that will generate a random prompt for journaling. I'd also like to view a history of generated prompts that is persistent between sessions. When I'm on the home page I'm presented with a prompt, as well as a button to generate a new prompt if I choose. Finally, I'd like a button that will bring up a list of all the prompts the page has generated for me.

### Features

- On desktop, page displays a random calming image from Unsplash
- The user can click a button to instantly get a new prompt
- Every prompt the user receives is kept in local storage
- The user can click a button to retrieve and view all previous prompts
